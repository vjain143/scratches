Customizing visualization in Pinterest Query Book to represent metadata from Trino can enhance the user experience by providing an intuitive, interactive way to explore catalogs, schemas, tables, and columns. While Query Book typically displays query results in a tabular format by default, many query tools (including Query Book) allow customization through visual widgets, dashboards, and filters. Below is a guide on how to customize visualizations in Query Book for metadata representation:

### Steps to Customize Visualization in Query Book

1. **Execute Metadata Queries:**
   - Write and execute the metadata queries in Query Book as described earlier. For example:
   
     **Fetch catalogs:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM system.metadata.catalogs;
     ```

     **Fetch schemas:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM hive.information_schema.schemata;
     ```

     **Fetch tables:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM hive.information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'default';
     ```

     **Fetch columns:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM hive.information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'default' AND table_name = 'your_table';
     ```

2. **Understand Query Book Visualization Options:**
   Query Book, like other SQL-based query tools, often includes visualization capabilities such as:
   - **Tables (default)**: Basic display of query results.
   - **Pivot Tables**: Aggregate and summarize data in multi-dimensional form.
   - **Bar Charts**: For comparisons, such as the number of tables per schema.
   - **Pie Charts**: For proportional data (e.g., table counts by schema).
   - **Tree View**: To represent hierarchical metadata like catalogs → schemas → tables.
   - **Dropdown Filters**: To allow users to select catalogs, schemas, or tables dynamically.

3. **Using Filters for Dynamic Exploration:**
   Create a **dropdown filter** for catalogs, schemas, and tables so users can dynamically explore the metadata. For example:
   - **Catalog Filter**: Fetch all catalogs, and present them in a dropdown so users can select one.
   - **Schema Filter**: Once a catalog is selected, display schemas for that catalog.
   - **Table Filter**: Once a schema is selected, display all tables within that schema.

   **Example SQL with Filter Integration:**
   - **Catalog Filter:**
     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT catalog_name FROM system.metadata.catalogs;
     ```
   - **Schema Filter (with catalog selection):**
     ```sql
     SELECT schema_name FROM ${catalog_name}.information_schema.schemata;
     ```
   - **Table Filter (with schema selection):**
     ```sql
     SELECT table_name FROM ${catalog_name}.information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = '${schema_name}';
     ```

4. **Customize Table View to Tree/Hierarchy View:**
   Represent the hierarchical nature of metadata by creating a tree or drill-down structure:
   - **Tree view**: Start with catalogs at the top, allowing users to click through to schemas, and then to tables, and finally to columns. The tree structure helps users navigate the hierarchy of metadata more intuitively.

     Example tools like D3.js or other embedded visualization frameworks in Query Book may be used if available, or:
   - Use **JOIN queries** to combine catalogs, schemas, and tables into a hierarchical view.

     Example SQL query to visualize all levels:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
       c.catalog_name, 
       s.schema_name, 
       t.table_name, 
       col.column_name 
     FROM system.metadata.catalogs c
     LEFT JOIN ${catalog_name}.information_schema.schemata s 
       ON c.catalog_name = s.catalog_name
     LEFT JOIN ${catalog_name}.information_schema.tables t 
       ON s.schema_name = t.table_schema
     LEFT JOIN ${catalog_name}.information_schema.columns col 
       ON t.table_name = col.table_name;
     ```

   **Visualization:**
   - Use an interactive table where rows are expandable to show nested levels (schemas, tables, columns).
   - **Graphical tree**: Display parent nodes (catalogs) connected to children (schemas and tables), either as a collapsible list or using visualization libraries if supported.

5. **Visualizing Metadata with Charts:**
   - **Pie Chart / Bar Chart for Schema Sizes**:
     Represent the number of tables per schema or the number of columns per table using pie or bar charts. This gives users a visual sense of the size or complexity of different parts of the database.

     **Example SQL for table count per schema:**
     ```sql
     SELECT table_schema, COUNT(*) AS table_count 
     FROM ${catalog_name}.information_schema.tables 
     GROUP BY table_schema;
     ```

   - **Bar Chart for Table Column Distribution**:
     Show how many columns exist per table in a schema. This is useful for understanding how "wide" a table is.

     **Example SQL for column count per table:**
     ```sql
     SELECT table_name, COUNT(column_name) AS column_count 
     FROM ${catalog_name}.information_schema.columns 
     WHERE table_schema = '${schema_name}'
     GROUP BY table_name;
     ```

6. **Creating Dashboards for Summary Views:**
   - **Catalog-Level Dashboard**: Display all catalogs and their basic metadata, such as the number of schemas in each catalog.
   - **Schema-Level Dashboard**: After a catalog is selected, show a summary of schemas, including the number of tables and columns.
   - **Table-Level Dashboard**: Provide detailed information on the number of rows, columns, and data types for each table in the selected schema.

### Example Use Case of a Dashboard in Query Book
1. **High-Level Metadata Overview**:
   - **Bar chart**: Catalog vs. Number of Schemas.
   - **Pie chart**: Schema distribution based on the number of tables.
   - **Line chart**: Growth of tables over time (if available).

2. **Interactive Hierarchical View**:
   - **Tree view**: Catalog → Schema → Table → Column.
   - Users can click on a catalog to drill down into schemas, then tables, and columns.

3. **Dynamic Filters**:
   - Allow the user to filter the metadata by catalog or schema name. Dropdowns can be dynamically populated based on user selection.

### Tools/Extensions for Visualization (if supported):
- **Embedded D3.js or other JavaScript libraries** for advanced visualizations like interactive charts or trees.
- **SQL visualization widgets**: Some platforms offer custom widgets to enhance data presentation.

By combining SQL queries with UI filters, tree structures, and charts, you can create a powerful visual experience for metadata exploration within Query Book.
