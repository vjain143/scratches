# Correctness
To measure whether data conforms to defined physical representations in Trino, you can use a combination of SQL queries, metadata inspection, and data profiling techniques. While Trino itself doesn't provide built-in data quality features, you can leverage its querying capabilities to perform various checks on your data. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Metadata Inspection**: Use Trino to query metadata from your data sources. This includes information such as column names, data types, and constraints. By comparing this metadata against your defined physical representations, you can ensure that data conforms to expectations. For example, you can check if the order of columns matches the expected order, if data types are consistent, and if constraints are met.

2. **Column Specification Validation**: Write SQL queries in Trino to validate if data adheres to fixed-width column specifications or other defined formats. For example, if you have a file with fixed-width columns, you can query the length of each column and compare it against the expected width. Similarly, you can check if data conforms to expected formats such as dates, numbers, or strings.

3. **Data Profiling**: Use Trino to profile your data and identify anomalies or discrepancies. Write SQL queries to calculate statistics such as minimum and maximum values, average, standard deviation, and frequency distributions for columns. Compare these statistics against expected ranges or distributions to identify data quality issues. For example, you can check for outliers, missing values, or unexpected patterns in your data.

4. **Custom Checks**: Write custom SQL queries or scripts in Trino to perform specific data quality checks tailored to your requirements. This could include checks for uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness, or consistency across different data sources. Use Trino's querying capabilities to execute these checks and flag any discrepancies or violations of defined physical representations.

5. **Integration with External Tools**: Integrate Trino with external data quality tools or frameworks that provide more advanced data profiling and validation capabilities. You can use Trino as a data source for these tools, allowing you to leverage its querying capabilities while benefiting from the additional features provided by the external tools.

By combining these approaches, you can establish a comprehensive data quality assurance process in Trino to ensure that your data conforms to defined physical representations and meets your quality standards.

## Correctness
To measure data correctness in Trino from a data consumer's point of view, particularly related to whether data conforms to defined physical representations, you can implement various techniques leveraging Trino's querying capabilities, metadata inspection, and data validation approaches. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Metadata Inspection**:
   - Use Trino to query metadata from your data sources to understand the physical representation of data, such as column names, data types, and constraints. You can use SQL queries to retrieve metadata information from tables or files.
   - Compare the retrieved metadata against the defined physical representations to ensure that data conforms to expectations. Check if the order of columns matches the expected order, if data types are consistent, and if constraints are met.

2. **Column Specification Validation**:
   - Write SQL queries in Trino to validate if data adheres to fixed-width column specifications or other defined formats. For example, if you have a file with fixed-width columns, you can query the length of each column and compare it against the expected width.
   - Use Trino's querying capabilities to execute these queries and identify any discrepancies between the actual data and the defined physical representations.

3. **Data Validation Checks**:
   - Perform data validation checks in Trino to ensure the correctness of data from a data consumer's viewpoint. Validate data against predefined criteria such as expected values, ranges, or formats.
   - Write SQL queries to identify data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in data representation. For example, you can check for NULL values in mandatory fields or validate data formats such as dates, numbers, or strings.

4. **Integration with Data Quality Tools**:
   - Integrate Trino with external data quality tools or frameworks that provide advanced data validation capabilities. You can use Trino as a data source for these tools, allowing you to leverage its querying capabilities while benefiting from the additional features provided by the external tools.
   - Use data quality tools to perform comprehensive data validation checks, including conformity to defined physical representations, and generate reports or alerts for any issues identified.

By implementing these techniques in Trino from a data consumer's point of view, you can effectively measure data correctness and ensure that data conforms to defined physical representations. Additionally, you can identify and address any data quality issues to maintain the integrity and reliability of your data.

# Completness 
To measure data completeness in Trino, particularly in terms of the availability of all required data records and inclusion of mandatory properties, you can employ various techniques leveraging Trino's querying capabilities, metadata inspection, and data validation approaches. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Count of Records**: Use Trino to query the total count of records in the dataset. Compare this count against the expected number of records to ensure all required data records are present. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM your_table;
    ```

2. **Validation of Mandatory Properties**: Write SQL queries in Trino to validate the presence of mandatory properties in the dataset. You can use conditional statements or assertions to check if certain columns or properties are populated. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM your_table
    WHERE mandatory_column IS NULL;
    ```

    This query will return the count of records where the mandatory column is NULL, indicating potential data quality issues.

3. **Checksum Validation**: If the provider sends a file with a checksum for data integrity verification, you can calculate the checksum of the data in Trino and compare it with the provided checksum. Although Trino does not have built-in support for checksum calculations, you can compute the checksum using custom SQL functions or external tools and then compare it with the expected checksum.

4. **File Header Inspection**: If the file contains a header with a row count or other metadata, you can extract and inspect this information in Trino to validate the completeness of the data. You may need to preprocess the file to extract the header information and then query it in Trino.

5. **Data Profiling**: Use Trino to profile the data and identify any missing or incomplete records. Write SQL queries to calculate statistics such as the count of distinct values, minimum and maximum values, and presence of NULL values for relevant columns. Analyze the profiling results to identify any data completeness issues.

By leveraging these techniques in Trino, you can establish a data quality validation process to ensure the completeness of your data in terms of both the availability of required records and the inclusion of mandatory properties. Additionally, you may need to collaborate with data providers to establish mechanisms for data validation and ensure data integrity during transmission.
