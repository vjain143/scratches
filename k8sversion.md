If the `.version_updated` file is present in the `develop` branch, it will indeed be present when you create a new release branch. To address this, you need to ensure that the `.version_updated` file is created only during the first build of the release branch and not merged back into `develop`.

### Solution

1. **Do Not Commit `.version_updated` to `develop`**: Ensure that `.version_updated` is used only for tracking within the release branch and not merged back into `develop`.
2. **Remove `.version_updated` After Merging**: Clean up `.version_updated` from the release branch after merging.

```groovy

    agent any

    environment {
        REPO_URL = 'https://your-repo-url.git'
        CREDENTIALS_ID = 'your-credentials-id'

    stages {
        stage('Detect Release Branch') {

                }

            steps {

                }

        stage('Increment Version') {

### Explanation

- **Detect Release Branch**: This stage checks if the current branch is a release branch using a regex pattern.
- **Increment Version**:
  - **Condition**: The stage runs only if it's a release branch and the `.version_updated` file does not exist.
  - **Read Current Version**: Reads the current version from `version.txt`.
  - **Increment Version**: Increments the version number.
  - **Update Version File**: Updates `version.txt` with the new version.
  - **Track Update**: Creates a `.version_updated` file to track that the version has been updated.
  - **Commit and Push**: Commits and pushes `version.txt` and `.version_updated` to the release branch.
- **Merge to Develop**: 
  - **Condition**: Runs only if `.version_updated` exists.
  - **Merge**: Merges the release branch into the `develop` branch.
  - **Clean Up**: Removes the `.version_updated` file from the release branch and commits this change.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Ignore `.version_updated`**: Ensure `.version_updated` is included in the `.gitignore` file of your repository to avoid committing it inadvertently to other branches.

2. **Commit Configuration**: Ensure Jenkins is set up with proper user credentials to commit changes.

3. **Testing**: Test this setup with a mock release branch to ensure it works as expected before applying it to your production branches.

By following these steps, you ensure that the version update process is controlled and only happens during the first build of the release branch, while preventing the `.version_updated` file from being merged back into the `develop` branch.
