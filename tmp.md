To create a use case for the scenario where an engineer works on a new feature for an old version, we'll structure it with a focus on the actions, preconditions, postconditions, and the steps involved. Here’s how you can write it:

### Use Case: Developing a New Feature for an Old Version

**Title:** Develop and Deploy a New Feature for an Old Version

**Actor:** Engineer

**Goal:** To develop a new feature for an older version of the software and ensure it is correctly integrated and deployed.

**Preconditions:**
- The old version has a dedicated master branch (e.g., `master_v1`).
- The engineer has access to the repository and the necessary permissions.
- The version release branch may or may not exist (e.g., `release_v1.1.0`).

**Postconditions:**
- The new feature is integrated into the version release branch.
- The feature is deployed to production.
- The changes are merged back into the master branch for that version.

**Main Success Scenario (MSS):**
1. **Identify the Version Branch:**
   - The engineer identifies the appropriate master branch for the old version (e.g., `master_v1`).

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   - The engineer creates a new feature branch from the version’s master branch (e.g., `feature_v1_new-feature`).
     ```sh
     git checkout master_v1
     git pull origin master_v1
     git checkout -b feature_v1_new-feature
     ```

3. **Develop the Feature:**
   - The engineer develops the new feature on the `feature_v1_new-feature` branch.
   - Regular commits are made to save progress and ensure version control.

4. **Create or Update the Release Branch:**
   - If the release branch for the target version doesn’t exist, the engineer creates it (e.g., `release_v1.1.0`).
     ```sh
     git checkout -b release_v1.1.0
     git push origin release_v1.1.0
     ```
   - If it exists, the engineer checks it out and updates it with the latest changes from the master branch.
     ```sh
     git checkout release_v1.1.0
     git pull origin release_v1.1.0
     git merge master_v1
     ```

5. **Merge Feature Branch into Release Branch:**
   - Once development is complete, the engineer merges the feature branch into the release branch.
     ```sh
     git checkout release_v1.1.0
     git merge feature_v1_new-feature
     git push origin release_v1.1.0
     ```

6. **Deploy to Production:**
   - The release branch (`release_v1.1.0`) is deployed to production following the deployment protocols.

7. **Merge Back to Master Branch:**
   - After successful deployment, the engineer merges the changes from the release branch back into the master branch for the version.
     ```sh
     git checkout master_v1
     git pull origin master_v1
     git merge release_v1.1.0
     git push origin master_v1
     ```

8. **Clean Up:**
   - The engineer deletes the feature branch if it is no longer needed.
     ```sh
     git branch -d feature_v1_new-feature
     git push origin --delete feature_v1_new-feature
     ```

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Branch Conflicts:** If there are conflicts during the merge steps, the engineer resolves them following the standard conflict resolution process.
- **Rollback:** If the feature causes issues in production, a rollback procedure is followed to revert to the previous stable state.

**Extensions:**
- **Testing:** Before deployment, the feature is thoroughly tested in a staging environment.
- **Documentation:** The engineer updates any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made by the new feature.

This use case ensures a structured and clear approach to developing and deploying features for older versions of the software, minimizing disruptions and maintaining code integrity across different versions.


The diagram appears to represent a Kubernetes cluster architecture, focusing on services related to Trino and its supporting components in a distributed setup. Here is a high-level overview:
	1.	Namespaces and Segmentation:
	•	The diagram is organized into namespaces or logical groupings, each with a specific focus, such as Trino, MinIO, Redis, and Hive.
	•	Each namespace contains a set of Kubernetes resources.
	2.	Key Services:
	•	Trino: The primary service being orchestrated within the cluster.
	•	Redis: Likely used for caching or session management.
	•	MinIO: An object storage solution for distributed systems.
	•	Hive Metastore: Supporting the Trino data querying system.
	•	Hive Storage: Indicates a connection to Hive tables or data storage.
	3.	Components:
	•	Pods: Represented throughout, showcasing microservices or application components.
	•	Ingress/Load Balancers: Handle traffic routing to the services.
	•	Persistent Volumes (PVs): Provide storage for stateful applications like databases.
	•	ConfigMaps and Secrets: Manage configurations and sensitive data.
	4.	Underlying Infrastructure:
	•	It shows connections to a data storage layer at the bottom, possibly representing a database or external storage system, such as MySQL or HDFS.
	•	These connections ensure Trino and related services can access the necessary data.
	5.	Service Dependencies:
	•	Lines and arrows illustrate dependencies and data flows among the components.
	•	Examples include how Trino might interact with Hive and Redis to fetch query data and caching results.
	6.	Cluster Management:
	•	At the edges, there are components for monitoring, logging, or scaling.
	•	Likely includes tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or Kubernetes-native resources like Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA).




Production drift in this Kubernetes-based architecture refers to the unintentional or unplanned differences between the desired state of your cluster (as defined in configurations, manifests, and Infrastructure-as-Code) and its actual state in the production environment. This can occur due to various reasons. In the context of this diagram, here are the potential areas where production drift might happen:

1. Resource Configuration Drift

	•	Misaligned Configurations: Updates to ConfigMaps, Secrets, or Deployment manifests in production might not align with the configurations stored in the source control (e.g., Git).
	•	Unintended Manual Changes: Admins or developers making ad-hoc edits to production pods, services, or deployments can cause mismatches.
	•	Version Drift: Pods running outdated versions of containers (e.g., Trino, Redis) due to skipped upgrades or failed Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.

2. Infrastructure Drift

	•	Storage Mismatches: Persistent Volumes (PVs) or Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) might be using incorrect storage classes, capacities, or access modes.
	•	Load Balancers and Ingress Rules: Manual tweaks in ingress configurations or cloud-managed load balancers may create differences between dev/test and production environments.
	•	Cluster Nodes: Underlying Kubernetes nodes might not match the expected specifications (e.g., node labels, taints, or resource allocations).

3. Service and Scaling Drift

	•	Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Issues: Mismatches in autoscaling policies (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configurations) or unexpected scaling limits.
	•	Pod Scheduling Issues: Tolerations, node selectors, or affinity rules applied manually may differ between environments.

4. Dependency Drift

	•	Data Source Changes: The Trino service heavily relies on external systems like Hive Metastore, Redis, MinIO, and backend storage (e.g., MySQL). Any untracked changes to these external dependencies can result in drift.
	•	Networking Rules: Updates to service-to-service communication (e.g., firewall rules or Kubernetes network policies) might not reflect the expected state.

5. Security Drift

	•	Secrets Mismanagement: Secrets (e.g., for Redis or MySQL connections) might not be rotated regularly, or manual updates may not sync with defined configurations.
	•	RBAC Policies: Role-based access control settings might drift due to manual changes to permissions or roles.
	•	Image Vulnerabilities: Production workloads might still use container images with outdated dependencies or security vulnerabilities, contrary to defined policies.

6. Monitoring and Observability Drift

	•	Metrics Gaps: Differences in monitoring configurations (e.g., Prometheus scrape intervals) may lead to gaps in observability.
	•	Alert Rules: Production alerts might not align with what is defined in the source control or expected monitoring setup.

How to Detect and Manage Production Drift

To minimize and detect production drift:
	1.	Implement GitOps: Use tools like ArgoCD or Flux to ensure that the production state matches what is in version control.
	2.	Enable Continuous Monitoring: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Open Policy Agent (OPA) to detect drift in real time.
	3.	Run Infrastructure Scans: Tools like kubectl diff, terraform plan, or kube-score can help validate your production cluster state.
	4.	Set Alerts for Manual Changes: Use Kubernetes audit logs to detect unauthorized or manual changes.
	5.	Automate Rollbacks: Configure pipelines to automatically roll back unintentional changes.
